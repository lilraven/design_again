    <h1 >WHAT MAKES SOMETHING ART?</h1>

        <p>If you want to see a name-calling, hair pulling intellectual fight (and who doesn’t), just yell this question in a crowded coffee shop. After centuries of debate and goatee-stroking, it’s still a hot-button issue

Before the 14th century, the Western world grouped painting, sculpture, and architecture with decorative crafts such as poetry, weaving, and the like. During the Renaissance, Michelangelo and the gang elevated the artist to the level of the poet – a genius who was touched by divine inspiration.  Now, with God as a collaborator, art had to be beautiful, which meant that artists had to recreate reality in a way that transcended earthly experience.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, artists rejected these standards of beauty; they claimed that art didn’t need to fit set requirements. This idea is now widely accepted, though people still disagree over what is and isn’t art.

A common modern view is that art is anything that is created for its own aesthetic value – beautiful or not – rather than to serve some other function. So, according to this theory, defining art comes down to the creator’s intention. If you build a chair to have something to sit on, the chair isn’t a piece of art. But if you build an identical chair to express yourself, that chair is a piece of art. Marcel Duchamp demonstrated this in 1917, when he turned a urinal upside down and called it “Fountain.” He was only interested in the object’s aesthetic value. And just as simply as that: art.

This may seem arbitrary, but to the creator, there is a difference. If you build something for a specific purpose, you measure success by how well your creation serves. That function. If you make pure art, your accomplishment is exclusively determined by how the creation makes you feel. Artists say that they follow their hearts, their muses, or God, depending on their beliefs. A craftsperson also follows a creative spirit, but his or her desire for artistic fulfillment is secondary to the obligation to make something that is functional.

Many objects involve both kinds of creativity. For example, a big-budget filmmaker follows his or her muse generally bends to the studio bends to studio demands to try to make the movie profitable. (For instance, the movie might be trimmed to ninety minutes.) Unless the director has full creative control, the primary function of the film is to get people to buy tickets. There’s nothing wrong with making money from your art, but purists say that financial concerns should never influence the true artist.

By a purist’s definition, a book illustration isn’t art, since its function is to support the text, please the client – even if the text is a work of art the counter view is that the illustration is art, since the illustrator follows his or her creative instincts to create it; the illustrator is a much an artistic collaborator as the writer.

Obviously, it gets pretty murky. But until someone invents a handheld art detector, the question of what makes something art  will continue to spark will continue to spark spirited  arguments in coffee shops the world over.
